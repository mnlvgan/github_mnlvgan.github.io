--How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion
I accomplished each item in the criteria by following a recommended video tutorial on YouTube. While I replicated most of the code demonstrated in the tutorial, I also made some attempts to tweak the code to personalize the website. Unfortunately, my limited coding skills led to the website looking less aesthetically pleasing and I struggled to identify and fix the issues. Eventually, I found myself rewatching the two-hour tutorial to pinpoint the problems. Despite the challenges, I appreciate the learning experience, and I am satisfied with the website's clean, simple, and professional appearance.

--Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
While working on the tasks, I realized that GitHub is super handy in programming because it lets you easily share and work on code together. It's like a cool space for developers to team up and manage projects. As for HTML and CSS, I learned that they both work together to make websites. HTML is like the skeleton, setting up the structure and content, while CSS adds the style, making things look good.

--Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
I didn't have issues with GitHub because the tutorial was clear. But when it comes to HTML and CSS, the struggle was real, especially with styling the HTML part. It's tough when you're not naturally good at design.

--How you could improve your website in the future
I thought about adding more hover effects, especially in the projects section. My idea was that when I hover over a project, it would display the project description on top of the picture and blur the image. Although I implemented it, I wasn't entirely satisfied with how it looked, especially on smaller resolutions like phones. That's why I ended up keeping the description showing at the bottom instead of on the picture.
